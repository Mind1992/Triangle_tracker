<h1>Triangle Tracker</h1>

Written by Sergii and Katharine Chen.

If a user enters an invalid triangle, pop up an alert when they try to submit the form.

You can reference your code from last week on figuring out what type of triangle three sides form. Create a method on your triangle objects called type() that returns the type of triangle it is. Hint: the method shouldn't take any arguments, as it can reference its own sides using the this keyword.

Don't worry about writing tests; we'll get to that in the next lesson.
